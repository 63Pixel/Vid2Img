# Vid2Img
This script automatically extracts frames from a video file in the script directory by allowing the user to select the frame rate (FPS) for export. 
It offers GPU support for more efficient processing and allows saving the exported images in either JPG or PNG format. 
The resulting images are saved in the "Export" folder of the script directory.

CV2 Module is needed.
